Signature of delegate and example of each delegate

	Whenever we use delegates, we have to declare a delegate then initialize it, then we call a method with a reference variable.
	 
	In order to get rid of all the first steps, we can directly use Func, Action, or Predicate delegates.
	The Func delegate takes zero, one or more input parameters, and returns a value (with its out parameter).
	Action takes zero, one or more input parameters, but does not return anything.
	Predicate is a special kind of Func. It represents a method that contains a set of criteria mostly defined inside an if condition and checks whether the passed parameter meets those criteria or not.
	It takes one input parameter and returns a boolean - true or false.
