Topic – OOPS, Collection & User Defined Exception
Theory:
1. Difference between 
	Parse() method
	Convert class and
	TryParse() method
	with check odd even example
	

3. Find out why there is question marks after string for toString() method in Object class: Virtual string? toString(); .

4. what is inner exception with example?

5. what is difference between constant and readonly variable?

Practical:

Start new Project as Class Library. Name it as HRLib

Create Employee Class
Employee
	String Name - property
	String Address – property
Total Constructor : 2
Define 	Constructor with parameters (2 Parameter)

Define abstract method CalculateSalary return double takes no parameter



Write sub class ConfirmEmployee. Derived from Employee

Variables / Properties
	Double	 Basic 
	String Designation 

Total no of constructors : 2

Define parameterized constructor (4 arguments)

Override CalculateSalary method which return NetSalary
This method cannot be “override” by child class

Logic of CalculateSalary

If Basic >= 30000
	Hra – 30% of basic
	Conv – 30 % of basic
	PF – 10% of basic

If Basic >= 20000
	Hra – 20% of basic
	Conv – 20 % of basic
	PF – 10% of basic

Else
	Hra – 10% of basic
	Conv – 10 % of basic
	PF – 10% of basic

NetSalary = basic + Hra + Conv - pf







Define Trainee class. Derived from Employee
Properties
	Int 		No of Days
	Double 	Rate per day

No of constructors : 2

Define parameterized constructor (4 parameters)

Overrride CalculateSalary method

Logic for the method

NoOfDays * Rate


•	Override ToString() method in all classes

•	Create Empno as a int property which is auto generated unique value (means you will not take this value from the user but your Employee class  internally generate and assign unique value)

•	Exception Handling
Keep check that for Confirm Employee minimum basic is Rs. 5000 
If less throw User Defined Exception

Create Console Application. Name it as HRAPP and test all 2 classes by creating object and call the method
